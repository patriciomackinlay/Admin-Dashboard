The Odin Project - Admin Dashboard

In this project I will use the HTML and CSS knowledge I've been gaining throughout The Odin Project's full stack course.
I'll be following the provided design file, while taking some liberties, like the theme of the app and the general aesthetics.
My main goal is to solidify my CSS skills so that I'm more comfortable tackling UI/front-end projects.
